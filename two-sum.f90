! **Problem**: (https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
! Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
! You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
! You can return the answer in any order.

! **Comment**:
! I think there is potential to improve this code.
! But hey, it's Fortran! What did you expect? A high level algorithm?
! I mean, the execution time on my machine is on around 18sec which
! is really fast and to be fair, I didn't think that it would be that fast.
!
! I could as well only test this on the 3 Test Cases LeetCode
! gave to me so I don't know if it would pass all of them.
